Function-wise Optimization Suggestions

1. sum_large_numbers

- Using Python's built-in sum() instead of manual loops for faster execution.

- Reducing nested or repeated loops wherever possible.

-Using NumPy arrays for handling very large datasets efficiently.

2. add

- Minimize repeated calculations inside the function.

- Optimize memory usage by avoiding unnecessary variable assignments.

3. star_triangle

- Reduce the number of print statements during computation (printing inside loops is slow).

- Using list comprehension instead of nested loops
